        <h3 class="tv1-text">Can you be so self-absorbed that you have no idea what’s truly going on around you? Lee
            Young Joon (Park Seo
            Joon) is vice president of his family-owned company, Yoomyung Group. He is so narcissistic that he doesn’t
            pay attention to what his trusty secretary, Kim Mi So (Park Min Young), is trying to tell him most of the
            time.
            After nine years of making Young Joon look good and stroking his very large ego, Min So decides to quit her
            job. Young Joon’s younger brother, Lee Sung Yeon (Lee Tae Hwan), is a famous author who is in love with Mi
            So.

            Can Young Joon accept the fact that Mi So no longer wants to work for him or will he get the wrong idea?

            “What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim” is a 2018 South Korean drama series directed by Park Joon Hwa. It is based
            on a novel by Jung Kyung Yoon. A 2016 webcomic by Kim Young Mi also was based on the same novel.

        <h3 class="tv2-text">The series follows Elliot Alderson, a young man living in New York City, who works at the
            cybersecurity company Allsafe as a cybersecurity engineer. Constantly struggling with social anxiety,
            dissociative identity disorder and clinical depression, Elliot's thought process seems heavily influenced by
            paranoia and delusion. He connects to people by hacking them, which often leads him to act as a
            cyber-vigilante. He is recruited by a mysterious insurrectionary anarchist known as Mr. Robot and joins his
            team of hacktivists known as fsociety. One of their missions is to cancel all consumer debt by encrypting
            all the data of one of the largest corporations in the world, E Corp (which Elliot perceives as Evil Corp),
            which also happens to be Allsafe's biggest client.
